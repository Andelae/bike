                <p>You enjoy going at your own speed. Taking it easy, sightseeing, or even picking up some groceries.
                    Enjoying the sites around you. Cruiser bikes are exactly what the name suggests. While they can’t
                    handle the rigors of off-roading, stunts, or countless miles of pavement, cruiser bikes are perfect
                    for those who just need a way to ride around in comfort, whether it’s for fun, or or an errand or
                    two.</p>
                <p>Cruisers usually have wide "balloon" tires, and handlebars that are even more upright, and in some
                    cases, swept back compared to hybrid bikes. Most cruiser bikes are single-speed or 3-speed, and have
                    the old-fashioned coaster brake (where you pedal backwards to stop). They can be used for
                    short-distance commuting and errands, as long as your route is fairly flat.</p>
