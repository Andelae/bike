                <p>You don't mind getting dirty. A bumpy path is what you enjoy. Mountain bikes are capable of handling
                    a variety of terrains depending on the type, and continue to be the go-to choice for biking
                    enthusiasts who crave a little more adventure and action with their riding.</p>
                <p>Mountain Bicycles are design for riding rough off-road trails. They have flat or upright handlebars,
                    and a very low gear range for pedaling up steep trails. Most mountain bikes have some type of shock
                    absorbers or suspension.</p>
