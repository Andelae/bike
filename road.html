                <p>You love going fast. Cars never scared you. The overall intention of a road bike is a high rate of
                    speed and maneuverability while also being as efficient as possible. This means that the bike can
                    achieve fast speeds without exerting an unreasonable amount of effort. Thus, the road bike design is
                    perfect for fitness enthusiasts, long distance riders, and competitive riding.</p>
                <p>Road bicycles are designed to be ridden fast on smooth pavement. They have smooth, skinny tires and
                    "drop" handlebars, and can be used for on-road racing. They are usually lighter than other types of
                    bicycles.</p>
